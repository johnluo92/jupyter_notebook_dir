    "- utilized my understanding in financial asset trading and applied them to create an automated trading system.\n",
    "- It had order entry, contract information, stop loss/profit attached order, custom strategy, and I even built a backtesting engine to validate what was the strategy.\n",
    "- The strategy largely did not perform consistently.\n",
    "- Due to the prices of crude oil/natural gas we were trading, the brokerage firm would execute our market order but actually wouldn't get executed due to as how a rep explained it, the price had changed too much to much and as the market order was converted a limit order, it would not get accepted so the broker had to change it quickly and multiple times. This was one technical limitation, another was simply because the entry was normally closer to \"worst case\" scenario, and so that impacted the level of profitability that was expected. The strategy didn't lose any money, but it also wasn't what it could have been. Overall I learned a lot, and transitioned to another similar role at a prop firm and moved onto Bloomberg as a global data analyst.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bloomberg\n",
    "- Bloomberg taught me a lot about what a good company looks like, young, agile, and endearing as the people there all seem to be engrained in their speciality. On a day-to-day I mainly handled entitlement requests from buy-side firms request research access on the Terminal, and because we don't actually own the research, we would liaise with sell-side firms that would eventually approve/disapprove the buy side's requests. We did this in a VBA macro custom built to handle the requests, and we would export the automated request to the terminal for servicing the requests. Once the sell-side sees them, they would add their clients to their research broadcast, enabling them access to content, and tools for better investment strategies and research.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I built a custom toolset to enable streamlined communication with sell-side clients in support of our efforts in updating the entire research entitlements system due to MIFID II's impact on decoupling research from trading commissions.\n",
    "- Another interesting part of the job was the research platform itself, it would take in files from sell-side firms and I had to make sure no issues arose during onboarding them. I created a systematic flowchart to help future analysts to be able to troubleshoot any problems in this area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vanguard\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vanguard was centralizaing their reference data for their Global Investment Data Management group responsible for onboarding, clearning, and exporting data using NeoXam's proprietary data management system called DataHub. During onboarding BlackRock right off the bat as I started a consultant at NeoXam, before becoming full-time at Vanguard, I had streamlined the creation of xml import connectors used to digest multiple security asset classes. These security classes and their reference data came into Vanguard's system based on trades placed on Aladdin. The software essentially handled the connectivity, cleaning and storing of data into Vanguard's oracle database for further processing, and eventual dissemination. Our team's system connected to charles river, portfolio management tool, accounting book of records, security pricing, etc. We took in data from many places, including an entirely different system of processes running on the same software in production called investment book of records that managed transactions, corporate actions, positions, cash - the team that oversees the development and support of the IBOR application helps risk teams, the PM tool, and complaince by sourcing centralized data in a similar fashion to what the security reference master team does with index, reference, and pricing data.\n",
    "- I mastered the process in creating connectors for importing data from multiple vendors, each might have different file formats, transmission techniques, and overall company/communication structure that required smooth communication and diligent project/time management skills.\n",
    "- xml nodes were throwing errors in the scheduler's logs and this had been piling up, but one day caused a failure of that scheduler which negatively affected multiples of other services and scheduled services. This was due to the BlackRock's xml file being read by each individual security type's connector. Because initial plans were to separate these connectors, we did not think about the limitations of the middleware to handle massive amounts of noise from this inefficient process, and so I set on to create a kornshell script involving SED, a unix utility, to parse the large xml trade files and divide them into smaller files by security types so that they can be picked up by each connector without throwing the xml node not found errors\n",
    "- the proprietary software was flexible in creating new features, and a missing component was the ability manually enter security reference informations, especially for swaps. So the we were brought together to create for 19 different security asset types' entry forms. I was able to actively manage this project for GIDM and communicate with all stakeholders on both R&D and other project managers that had an interest.\n",
